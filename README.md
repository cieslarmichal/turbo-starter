## ðŸ”§ Customizing TurboStarter for Your Application

To tailor TurboStarter to your specific application needs, follow these steps:

1. **Update Configuration Files**:
   - Modify the configuration files in the `apps/backend/config` directory to match your environment settings. For example, update `default.json`, `production.json`, `local.json`, and `test.json` with your database credentials, AWS keys, and other environment-specific settings.

2. **Modify Deployment Workflows**:
   - Edit the GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory to suit your deployment process. For example, you can enable or disable certain steps in `ci.yml`, `deployment-backend.yml`, and `deployment-frontend.yml`. If you want to use existing Fly.io deployment workflows, you need to set up a Fly.io account and configure the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository.

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Ensure that you update the documentation in the `README.md` file and any other relevant documentation files to reflect the changes and customizations you have made.

4. **Rename the Project**:
   - Rename the project from `TurboStarter` to your desired project name. Update the `name` field in the `package.json` file and any other references to `TurboStarter`, `turbo-starter` in the codebase.
